**Turn rough thoughts into clear text.**

**Inklet** is a macOS writing assistant that helps you turn typed, pasted, or spoken thoughts into clear text without leaving the app you are already using.

Use the global shortcut to open the writing popover, then type, paste, or dictate into the same editable source draft. Realtime dictation stays inside Writing Assistant so you can review the transcript before deciding whether to transform or insert it.

## Demo

Watch the demo video: [Inklet on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5wmFruo0a4).

## Install

GitHub Releases is Inklet's only supported distribution channel. Download the latest signed and notarized DMG from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/wanming/Inklet/releases), open it, and copy Inklet to `/Applications`.

Alternatively, use the install script below. The install script downloads the latest GitHub Releases DMG and checksum, verifies the DMG structure, checksum, Gatekeeper acceptance, bundle identifier, Hardened Runtime, effective entitlements, and app signature, and then copies Inklet to `/Applications`.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wanming/Inklet/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

## Updates

Inklet uses GitHub Releases as its only update source. Production builds check GitHub for public metadata for the latest stable release about once every 24 hours. An update is announced only after that release has an uploaded `Inklet.dmg`; **View on GitHub** opens that exact release page. Inklet never downloads or installs updates automatically.

Use **Check for Updates…** from the app menu to check manually in either the production app or Inklet Local. Inklet Local never schedules automatic checks. Automatic check failures are silent, while a manual check offers **Retry**. If writing, dictation, Selection Actions, migration, a modal, or an open menu makes Inklet busy, an automatic update notice waits until the app is idle.

## First-Time Setup

1. Open Inklet from your Applications folder. For a source build, run `scripts/run-local-app.sh` from the repository root, then use `/Applications/Inklet Local.app`.
2. Click the Inklet menu bar icon and open Settings.
3. Grant Accessibility permission when macOS asks. Inklet uses this one generic permission to read selections, perform a configured copy fallback, return focus to the previous app, and paste confirmed results. Inklet stays in the background while System Settings is open and returns to General settings when you close it.
4. Enter your OpenAI API key in General. Inklet uses this one key for writing, realtime dictation, selection translation, and pronunciation.
5. Configure Writing Assistant with the model, writing shortcut, generation settings, prompt modes, Dictation hold shortcut, and microphone you want to use. Advanced Dictation exposes only the recovery model; the recovery endpoint is not editable. The realtime model is fixed by Inklet.
6. Optional: configure Selection Assistant with a translation language, Force Selection mode, AI pronunciation voice, and pronunciation speed, then preview the voice in Settings.
7. Grant Microphone permission on the first valid Dictation hold. Opening Inklet, visiting Settings, or pressing the Dictation shortcut outside the active source editor does not request it.

## Everyday Use

Text workflow:

1. Focus any text field in another app.
2. Press `Option+Space`.
3. Fuzzy-search for a prompt mode (for example, `ts` can match `To Chinese Summary`), use `Up` / `Down` to highlight it, then press `Tab` or `Enter` to commit the mode.
4. Type or paste rough text.
5. Press `Enter` to transform it.
6. Press `Enter` again to insert the result.

Dictation workflow:

1. **Open Writing Assistant** with `Option+Space`.
2. **Confirm a Prompt Mode**. Dictation is unavailable in the mode picker and result editor.
3. **Put the caret in the source draft, or select text to replace.** Dictation inserts at the caret or replaces the selection.
4. **Hold the configured Dictation shortcut** (Right Option by default) and speak normally while the draft updates in place. A short press does nothing. If the realtime connection fails, keep holding and speaking while Inklet keeps one temporary recovery recording.
5. **Release to finalize** the transcript. If recovery is needed, Inklet sends one request to `https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions` with the same existing OpenAI API key used by realtime dictation. The temporary recording remains local until the fallback request actually begins, is uploaded at most once, and is deleted when the session ends.
6. Review and edit the dictated draft. Dictation by itself does not run the Prompt Mode or insert text into another app.
7. **Press Return only when ready** to run the confirmed Prompt Mode; press Return again only when you want to insert the result.

The Dictation shortcut is source-local and hold-only. You can change its modifier key to Right Command, Left Option, Left Command, or Disabled in Settings. Escape, focus loss, popover closure, or opening another source session cancels dictation and restores the original draft.

## What It Does

- Opens from a global macOS hotkey. The default is `Option+Space`.
- Streams realtime dictation into the active Writing Assistant source editor while a modifier-key shortcut is held. The default is Right Option.
- Shows Selection Actions after you select text in another Mac app and pause briefly, with EasyDict-style selection reading, quick translation, a customizable Translate prompt, AI pronunciation, resizable translation results that remember their last size, and 7-day local caching for repeated translations.
- Ignores selected text longer than 1,500 characters to avoid accidental long-page triggers.
- Plays selected text directly, and can play both the original text and translated text from the translation result.
- Transforms text with built-in prompt modes:
  - To Simple and Correct English
  - To Chinese Summary
  - Voice Cleanup
- Inserts generated text back into the previously focused app.
- Uses one application-agnostic, Accessibility-first selection path. Automatic Selection Actions first ask macOS Accessibility for the selection, then use the configured temporary clipboard fallback only when Force Selection permits it. Each read stays bound to the captured source process and cancels if that process exits or loses focus.
- Keeps simulated `Command+C` off by default. Menu Copy remains the safe Force Selection fallback; you can explicitly enable simulated copy as an advanced fallback for apps without a usable Copy menu, but it may interfere with games, remote desktops, or virtual machines.
- Serializes temporary clipboard reads and restores the prior snapshot only while the same read still owns the observed copy result; newer clipboard contents win. The double-copy trigger is passive: it consumes the copy the user already made without issuing another synthetic copy or restoring older clipboard data. Right-click remains native and never starts a selection read.
- Does not use browser-specific selection code and does not request browser Automation. Chrome, Safari, Edge, and native apps use the same generic path.
- Lets you edit prompt modes, OpenAI model, timeout, writing shortcut, Dictation hold shortcut, microphone, recovery model, selection translation language, selection Translate prompt, Force Selection mode, simulated-copy permission, AI pronunciation voice, and AI pronunciation speed.
- Shows local History for successful Write and Selection results, with consecutive duplicate entries collapsed, selectable source/result text, a result copy control, and a clear-all action. Existing legacy Voice entries remain readable.
- Uses one shared OpenAI API key for writing, realtime dictation, selection translation, and pronunciation.
- Provides English, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, and Italian app UI localization.
- Adapts compact selection menus and constrained settings/writing controls to translated labels; language changes refresh open UI while preserving writing content.

## Current Status

Inklet is an early MVP. The repository currently includes:

- A Swift Package for the macOS app and core writing engine.
- A menu bar app with a writing popover and settings window.
- Provider adapters and configuration storage.
- Unit tests for core behavior.
- Manual test notes in [docs/manual-test-checklist.md](docs/manual-test-checklist.md).

## Requirements

- macOS 14 or newer.
- Swift 6 toolchain.
- Full Xcode is recommended for XCTest support.
- Accessibility permission for Inklet, required for generic selection reading, configured copy fallback, returning focus to the previous app, and pasting the generated result.
- Microphone permission for realtime dictation while the shortcut is held.
- An OpenAI API key.

## Build And Run

Before each app bundle build, increase both `INKLET_VERSION` and `INKLET_BUILD_NUMBER` in the root `VERSION` file. Normally increment the patch version; use minor or major increments for larger changes. The build number must remain a positive integer greater than every previously used build number, including across marketing versions. Check the latest `main`, Git tags, all GitHub releases (including drafts), and active worktrees before choosing it. Inklet uses this build number alone to decide whether an update is newer.

Run remote GitHub DMG builds only from `main`, after merging and pushing the intended changes and updated `VERSION`. Dispatch `build-dmg.yml` with `--ref main`.

The DMG workflow checks for reused or lower build numbers before building; it does not increment either value automatically. See [release version checks](scripts/README.md#release-version-checks) for manual validation. Changing a packaged app's version requires rebuilding, signing, notarizing, and regenerating checksums; changing only the release title or filename does not update the app.

From the repository root:

```bash
swift build
scripts/run-local-app.sh
```

Use `scripts/run-local-app.sh` for routine manual app testing from any worktree. It installs and opens the stable `/Applications/Inklet Local.app` identity so macOS Accessibility and Keychain trust can be reused across rebuilds.

Run tests:

```bash
swift test
```

If tests fail because `XCTest` is unavailable, install the full Xcode app instead of using only Command Line Tools.

Check all UI languages with `scripts/check-localization.sh`. Add `--snapshots` to generate a local HTML gallery of synthetic native UI fixtures under `.build/localization-audit/`; the command prints its path. Pull requests run the localization checks automatically. See [localization coverage and remaining manual checks](docs/localization-audit.md).

## Keyboard Flow

- `Option+Space`: open the writing popover.
- `Right Option`: hold for Dictation while the Writing Assistant source editor is active. Change the modifier or disable it in Settings; a short press remains inert.
- `Up` / `Down` in the mode launcher: move the highlight through fuzzy-ranked prompt modes.
- `Tab`, `Return`, or keypad `Enter` in the mode launcher: commit the highlighted prompt mode and focus the source editor. Return remains available to confirm text or an IME candidate during active composition; Return with Command, Shift, Option, or Control does not commit a mode.
- `Enter` in the editor: transform the source text, insert a result generated by the current mode, or regenerate a stale result from a previous mode with the newly committed mode.
- `Command+Enter`: insert the original text without calling the model.
- `Command+Up` / `Command+Down`: cycle through visible prompt modes.
- `Escape`: move back one level per press, from the result to the source editor, then to the mode launcher, then close the popover. While transforming, it cancels generation and stays in the editor.
- `Command+,`: open Settings while Inklet is active.

Search is case- and diacritic-insensitive and supports ordered-character matching. Exact and prefix matches receive the strongest boosts; consecutive, word-start, earlier, and tighter matches generally rank higher.

When the mode launcher opens, the last committed prompt mode is highlighted if it is still visible. A single click highlights a mode; a double-click commits it. Returning to the launcher keeps the current draft and result.

## Development Notes

- Keep provider behavior covered by focused unit tests.
- Use [docs/manual-test-checklist.md](docs/manual-test-checklist.md) before shipping user-facing app changes.
- Use `scripts/run-local-app.sh` instead of a bare SwiftPM executable or `open dist/...` for routine app hand-testing, so local Accessibility and Keychain approvals stay attached to one stable app identity.
- Treat the clipboard and Accessibility flows carefully; they are central to the app experience.
- The project is still MVP-stage, so README details should track the code rather than future plans.

## Local Storage And Upgrades

Production and local QA builds use bundle-qualified storage and do not share settings, History, translation cache, diagnostics, or Keychain credentials:

- Production Application Support: `~/Library/Application Support/com.tomwan.inklet/`
- Local Application Support: `~/Library/Application Support/com.tomwan.inklet.local/`
- Production preferences: `~/Library/Preferences/com.tomwan.inklet.plist`
- Local preferences: `~/Library/Preferences/com.tomwan.inklet.local.plist`
- Production Keychain service: `Inklet.ProviderAPIKey`
- Local Keychain service: `Inklet.Local.ProviderAPIKey`

On first launch after upgrading from the legacy sandboxed build, Inklet automatically copies recognized legacy preferences, provider API keys into the matching Keychain service, and History into the current bundle's storage. It does not delete or modify the legacy source, so the old data remains available for rollback or recovery. The disposable translation cache is not migrated.

If macOS blocks automatic access to the matching legacy container, Settings keeps an **Import Old Data…** action available. The assisted import validates the exact legacy `Data` folder for the running production or local bundle, reads it only while the current file-panel grant is valid, and does not save a persistent access bookmark.

## Privacy

- Inklet uses your configured OpenAI API key to call OpenAI for writing, realtime dictation, selection translation, and pronunciation.
- While you hold the Dictation shortcut, active microphone audio is streamed directly to OpenAI Realtime transcription. Inklet also keeps one temporary local recovery recording. It remains local until the fallback request actually begins, is uploaded at most once to `https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions` using the same existing OpenAI API key used by realtime dictation, and is deleted on every terminal session path.
- Your OpenAI API key is stored locally on your Mac.
- Inklet uses Accessibility permission for generic selection reading, configured copy fallback, returning focus to the previous app, and pasting text.
- Inklet uses Microphone permission only during a valid Dictation hold in the active Writing Assistant source editor. Finishing dictation leaves an editable draft and does not insert into another app.
- Inklet temporarily uses the clipboard for insertion and configured Force Selection fallback reads. A Force Selection read restores the previous clipboard only if Inklet's temporary copied value is still current, and does not overwrite a later external clipboard change.
- Inklet saves successful Write and Selection source/result text locally in History until you clear it in Settings, while skipping consecutive duplicate entries. An unprocessed dictated draft creates no History entry; existing legacy Voice entries remain locally readable.
- Selection Actions capture the source app and selection location, validate that source before and during the read, and use Accessibility to read its current selection. If Accessibility does not return selected text, the configured Force Selection mode can briefly invoke menu Copy and read the resulting clipboard text through the protected transaction described above. Simulated `Command+C` is off by default and runs only after an explicit advanced opt-in. You can turn Force Selection off in Settings. This path sends no browser-targeted Apple Events and does not request browser Automation. Pressing `Command+C` twice quickly after selecting text explicitly reads the copy you already made. Inklet does not save merely selected text unless a successful action is recorded in local History.
- Selection Assistant caches successful translation results locally for 7 days using hashed cache keys to speed repeated translations.
- Selection Assistant translation sends selected text and your custom Translate instructions to OpenAI when no local cached translation is available; AI pronunciation sends selected text to OpenAI.
- Inklet fetches the public model catalog from `models.dev` at most once per day. This request does not include your text, audio, API keys, or app settings.
- Do not send private text or audio to OpenAI unless you trust OpenAI's data handling policies.
