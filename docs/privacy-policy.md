# Inklet Privacy Policy

Last updated: June 26, 2026

## Overview

Inklet is a macOS writing assistant. It helps you transform typed, pasted, or spoken text using the AI provider and speech provider you configure.

Inklet does not require an Inklet account and does not send your content to Inklet-controlled servers.

## Information Processed

Inklet may process:

- Text you type or paste into Inklet.
- Text selected or copied by you for insertion workflows.
- Text selected by you for Selection Actions.
- Successful Write, Voice, and Selection source/result text saved in local History.
- Temporary audio recorded when you start voice dictation.
- API keys and provider settings you enter.
- App settings such as prompt modes, model choices, shortcuts, and preferences.

## How Information Is Used

Inklet uses this information to:

- Transform or summarize text.
- Transcribe voice dictation.
- Insert text into the app you were using.
- Show past successful results in local History.
- Save your local settings.
- Store provider API keys locally.

## AI And Speech Providers

Inklet sends text and audio only to the provider endpoints you configure for app functionality.

Text may be sent to the selected AI provider for rewriting, summarization, or cleanup. Audio may be sent to the selected speech transcription provider for voice dictation.

Provider handling of your data is governed by the provider's own privacy policy and account terms. Do not send private text or audio to a provider unless you trust that provider.

Inklet may fetch the public model catalog from `models.dev` periodically, currently no more than once per day. This request does not include your text, audio, API keys, or app settings.

## Selection Actions

When Selection Actions are enabled, Inklet watches for selection-related mouse and keyboard events and then uses macOS Accessibility to read the currently selected text after a short pause. Inklet does not use the clipboard as a fallback for this feature and does not store merely selected text unless a successful action is saved in local History.

If you choose Translate, the selected text is sent to your configured LLM provider. If you choose Pronounce, the selected text is sent to OpenAI text-to-speech using your OpenAI API key. Some apps do not expose selected text through Accessibility; in those apps the floating menu may not appear.

## Local Storage

Inklet stores API keys locally in macOS Keychain. Inklet stores app preferences locally on your Mac.

Inklet stores successful Write, Voice, and Selection source/result text locally in History until you clear it in Settings.

Inklet temporarily uses the clipboard to insert text into the active app and then attempts to restore the previous clipboard contents.

## Permissions

Inklet requests the following macOS permissions:

- Accessibility: used to return focus to the previous app, insert text after you confirm insertion, and read selected text for Selection Actions after you select text.
- Microphone: used only while recording voice dictation that you start.

Inklet does not use these permissions to collect text from other apps in the background.

## Analytics And Tracking

Inklet does not include third-party advertising, tracking, or analytics in the current app.

If this changes, this policy and App Store privacy details must be updated before release.

## Data Retention

Inklet does not operate a server that stores your text, audio, API keys, or settings.

Data sent to your configured providers may be retained according to those providers' own policies.

Local History stays on your Mac until you clear it in Settings or remove the local app data.
